Ansible playbook/roles for installation and configuration of (most of) the software used in my personal/work machines and common configuration/customization files.

As I do my work mostly on a Mac, the machine OS is used as a proxy for deciding what roles/packages must be installed (e.g. installing nethack on a work machine would be too much distration), besides affecting installation and configuration methods (e.g. installing apackage via homebrew, pip or from source)

More information on what is done on each role can be found on [/roles](./roles)
